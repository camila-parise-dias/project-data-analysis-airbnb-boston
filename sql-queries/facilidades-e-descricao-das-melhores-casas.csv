Location, location, location. Cited as the three most important factors in determining the desirability of any residential property, the significance of location for any Boston, MA apartment community cannot be overstated. Fortunately, Chestnut Hill Realty is well aware of this fact, and we've made every effort to ensure that apartment rentals are not only well-positioned within their neighborhoods - close to public transportation, schools and shopping, but that the neighborhoods they are a part of are desirable and well-placed. We've sought out property locations in and around the Boston, Portsmouth and Providence areas with our residents in mind - and as a result we're able to offer the best value in apartment living in some of the most unique and interesting communities in the country."
